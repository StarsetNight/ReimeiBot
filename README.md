# ReimeiBot
A lightweight, customizable bot framework inspired by NoneBot2.

## About the Project
ReimeiBot is a NoneBot2-like bot framework built on the [NoneBot2](https://github.com/nonebot/nonebot2) engine and fully compliant with the [OneBot](https://onebot.dev) protocol. It's open-sourced under the **MIT License** — feel free to use, modify, and distribute it as needed.

## Core Principles
We designed ReimeiBot around four key pillars to balance functionality and usability:
- **Standardization**: Follows industry protocols (OneBot) for seamless integration with existing tools.
- **Customization**: Flexible architecture to adapt to diverse use cases (personal bots, enterprise tools, etc.).
- **Simplification**: Minimalist design to reduce learning costs and improve development efficiency.
- **Lightweighting**: Optimized resource usage to run smoothly on low-spec devices.

## Building the Project
ReimeiBot relies on NoneBot2's plugin loading system, which is inherently dynamic. **We do not recommend bundling it into a binary executable** — this would break the plugin extensibility that makes NoneBot2-based projects flexible.

For deployment, follow the standard NoneBot2 setup workflow (see [NoneBot2 Docs](https://nonebot.dev/docs/quick-start) for details).
